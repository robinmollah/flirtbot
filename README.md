# FlirtBot
## Overview
FlirtBot is a Java program to send pickup lines to a target at specific interval.

### Installation
* Click `clone` to Download the repository from [*release*](https://github.com/robinmollah/flirtbot/tree/release) branch
* Go to the `src` folder and run the `Main.java` file

### How to use
If you run the `Main.java` file, pickup lines will start to typed on any where you go at specific interval.

Suppose, you want to use it on *Facebook Messenger*. Goto *http://messenger.com*, put your mouse cursor on target 
text box. Run the program. xDDDD

#### Extended use
You can make a program to scrap pickup lines from different sources and put them in `pickuplines.txt` file. FlirtBot 
will read that. Do not forget to contribute in our project.

### Possible use cases
* You want to show how much you love your partner, but you don't have time to stay awake the whole night and send her
 "bla bla bla". In this case you can write the lines and run the program.
* Add anything comes on your mind.
